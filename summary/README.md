## What does *Notted* trying to solve?
Imagine a company, **SoftDrinks Co.** that provides soft drinks to the majority of restaurants in Tel Aviv area.

"SoftDrinks Co." has **5 salesmen** that making deals around town, and **3 truck drivers** that deliver the goods to each location on a weekly basis.

Every salesman has a unique knowledge about each client, and this knowledge helps him make better deals.

Every truck driver, knows the area he delivers to, and understand each venue needs.

#### This information is not shared!

If a one of the salesman resign, it will be **very hard for a new employee** to take his place.

If there is an important knowledge a truck driver knows about a venue, it wouldn't be able to share with his/hers peers!

## How do we solve the problem?
Introducing: **Notted**

Notted is a mobile application that uses GPS location to help your company's field agents **communicate better**!

With notted, each employee could leave "notes" attached to each location on a map for other agents to read later.

If there is important note in your area, *Notted* will send you a notification about it!
